**Supplementary material**   

This repository holds supplementary material for the journal article "Applying behavioral studies to the ecotoxicology of corals: a case study on *Acropora millepora*" by Roepke et al., published 2022 in Frontiers in Marine Science, Section Coral Reef Research (doi: 10.3389/fmars.2022.1002924). Please cite this paper if you use any of the resources supplied in this repository. 

In the study, *Acropora millepora* coral larvae were exposed to different antifouling coatings and recorded from above with two camera sets in parallel. 
In order to investigate the effect of the antifouling coatings on the swimming velocity and activity of the larvae, their tracks were analyzed using the software Noldus EthoVision XT with subsequent data analysis in R.  

Here, we supply: 
  1. A manual that offers guidance for the track analysis process in Noldus EthoVision XT  
  2. An RMarkdown (.Rmd) script that shows the analysis of the track data in RStudio (under Releases)   
  3. The knitted HTML version of the RMarkdown document that includes all results and figures (under Releases)  
  4. A document with supplementary tables from the paper  
  
A video walkthrough of the track analysis in Noldus EthoVision XT can be found [here](https://youtu.be/iKllYHpvXjk). 
  
Together, the supplementary materials can serve as a starting point for investigating coral larvae swimming behavior using Noldus Ethovision XT and R.
